# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

## Build the best regression model you can that predicts the weight of perch
## Using only two predictor variables  


# Perch
```{r}
perch<-filter(allthat,Species=="Perch")
perch<-select(perch,-1)
```

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")
library(car)
summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```
  
It appears that the best two categories to use to find the weight are height and width.  



```{r}
which.max(summary.out$adjr2)
```
```{r}
summary.out$which[2,]
```
  
  The summary shows that height and width are the best to use.  
  
# Bream
```{r}
Bream<-filter(allthat,Species=="Bream")
Bream<-select(Bream,-1)
```
  
```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Bream,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")
library(car)
summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```
